These nasm binaries are downloaded from:

https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds

If no nasm binary is found on the current system, an up to date version
is used from this directory. The other versions are used in CI for testing
compatibility with various nasm versions.

The binaries are extracted from the ./rpms directory (not under source control)
using the rpm-extract.sh script.
